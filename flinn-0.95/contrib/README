Here are use contributions to Flynn which either I haven't gotten around
to evaluating, won't be part of Flynn due to philosophical differences,
or stand alone in their own right.

flynn-fork.patch - by harold@the-collective.net
---------------- STATUS: will not be part of Flynn.
"Here's an update that forks before the execl, so that when you quit a
game, flynn is still there..."

analog-joystick.patch - by Craig Lamparter <craiger@hemna.rose.hp.com>
--------------------- STATUS: not evaluated
"I modified your source to be sensetive to analog joysticks - scrolling
was totally out of control (it processed events as the stick swung from an
extreme, back to center)."
